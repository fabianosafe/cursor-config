Eco Circular is an application developed to connect people who wish to dispose of recyclable materials with collectors who can reuse them. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as provided.

For a better experience when using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to: username, email address, gender, location, and photos.
